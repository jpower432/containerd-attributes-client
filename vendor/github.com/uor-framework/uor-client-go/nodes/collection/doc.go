package collection

// This package defines the Collection node type with loading and iteration strategies.

// The Collection type stores model.Node types in a graph structure.
// The reference implementation for the Collection node is to store the relationship
// between linked content within a collection of files (e.g. a collection of static files rendered by a web server).

// Basic iterator implementations are defines here within this package to iterate Collection child
// nodes as a slice in various orders.

// Since Collections can relate to other Collection instances, they implement the model.Node interface as well
// to allow storage and traversal of distributed, linked Collection nodes.
