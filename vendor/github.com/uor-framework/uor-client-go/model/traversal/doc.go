package traversal

// This package defines methods for traversing through a graph of
// model.Node types.
//
// The Tracker type stores node relationship information for traversal
// which includes a node traversal path and a node budget (if set).
//
// Walk walks a graph of node where the child nodes are resolved by the
// Handler type.
